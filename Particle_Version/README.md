Next Plan:
- generate the fibre map to generate more graceful graph.
    - After I take the method of fibre map, I generate a more ugly graph... Holy shit.
- improve the code to speed it up.
    - take the method above can cut down the time complexity.
- continue reading relating paper and try other methods.
    - sucks.
